"Hello."
"We've been expecting you."
"Not really, I just like saying that."
"The research shows it builds a sense of suspense."
bold("And we all trust the research, am I right?")
"So who am I?"
"I'm this guy:"

"I'm your puzzle steward,"
"or fun butler,"
"or doom bringer,"
"or whatever call me whatever you want, I don't care."

"So here's how this works:"
"1. Look for a new directory in your current directory that has a mysterious/intriguing/dangerous sounding name."
"Hint: it might be: "+magenta(path)
"2. In that directory you will find a "+red("CURIOUS DEVICE")+" called "+green("unlock")
"3. To use the "+red("CURIOUS DEVICE")+", run it as follows:"
""
"$ "+green("./unlock")
""
"4. It will print out some stuffs at you, the most important of which is a "+yellow("SEEEEECRET CODE")+"."
"5. Then try to use the "+red("CURIOUS DEVICE")+" like so:"
""
"$ "+green("./unlock ")+yellow("<SEEEEECRET CODE> ")+fg256("#999","(Slick color formatting not included, sorry)")
""
"6. It will print out some more stuffs at you, and make new options available to you in the current directory."
"7. In these options, there will be yet more "+red("CURIOUS DEVICES")+" that will pose you with puzzles."
"These devices are run just like the one in the top level."
"8. Solve the puzzles, and you will be given more "+yellow("<SEEEEECRET CODES>")+" which you can use to unlock additional puzzles."
"Capisce?"
"Fun fact: capisce is the third person singular present tense of the Italian verb capire, 'to understand'."
"He/she/they understand?"
"We're woke gender-conscious folk around here. All are welcome in the"

"Have fun."

""
"Oh, by the way..."
"If you need a hint in the puzzles, you can pass the word 'hint' to the device to get some help."
"Maybe.\n"
