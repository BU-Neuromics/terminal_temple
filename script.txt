EGON: It's Gozer.
WINSTON: I thought Gozer was a man.
EGON: It's whatever it wants to be.
PETER: Well, whatever it is, it's gotta get by us!
RAY: Right!
PETER: Go get her, Ray!
RAY: Gozer the Gozerian! Good evening! As a duly designated representative of the
state, county and city of New York, I order you to cease any and all supernatural
activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest
convenient parallel dimension!
PETER: That ought to do it. Thanks very much, Ray.
GOZER:Are you a god?
RAY: No.
GOZER: Then... die!
WINSTON: Ray, when someone asks you if you're a god, you say, "Yes!"
PETER: All right. This chick is toast! Got your stick?
PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON: Holding!
PETER: Heat 'em up!
PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON: Smoking!
PETER: Make 'em hard!
PETER, RAY, EGON, WINSTON: Ready!
PETER: Let's show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown. Strike!
*They blast GOZER. It yowls and flips across the temple.*
PETER: Nimble little minx, isn't she? Aim for the flat top!
*They blast again. GOZER vanishes.*
PETER: Well! That wasn't so hard.
RAY: We neutralized it! You know what that means? A complete particle reversal!
WINSTON: Hey, we have the tools, we have the talent!
PETER: It's Miller time!
EGON: Ray? This looks extraordinarily bad.
*Earthquake at the temple. Rocks fall.*
EGON: Look out!
GOZER: Subcreatures! Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor, Volguus
Zildrohar, the Traveler, has come! Choose and perish!
RAY: What do you mean, choose? We don't understand!
GOZER: Choose! Choose the form of the Destructor!
PETER: Whoa! I get it, I get it. Very cute! Whatever we think of - if we think
of J. Edgar Hoover, J. Edgar Hoover will appear and destroy us, okay? So empty
your heads. Empty your heads. Don't think of anything. We've only got one shot
at this.
GOZER: The choice is made! The Traveler has come!
PETER: Whoa! Whoa! Nobody choosed anything! Did you choose anything?
EGON: No!
PETER: Did you?
WINSTON: My mind's totally blank!
PETER: I didn't choose anything!
RAY (trembling): I couldn't help it. It just popped in there!
PETER: What? What just popped in there?
RAY: I - I tried to think -
EGON: Look!
RAY: No! It can't be!
WINSTON: What is it?
RAY: It can't be!
WINSTON: What did you do, Ray?
RAY: It can't be!
WINSTON: Aw, shnikeys!
RAY (solemnly): It's the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man.
